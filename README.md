# Molten's Behaviour Tree Creator
Hello and welcome to the repository of Molten's Behaviour Tree Creator!
This is a currently in development Unity asset that is designed to facilitate the easy development of complex A.I behaviour.

I have a devlog in progress to show my research and development progress of the asset too.

## Overview
As I mentioned, this asset is planned to be a free asset package for Unity 2019.2.17f and higher.
I will also be creating documentation along the way to aid the integration of the asset package.

### Package Features/Contents
- [x] Composite Nodes
- [x] Leaf Nodes
- [ ] Decorator Nodes
- [ ] Visual Node Graph Editor
- [ ] Documentation

### Current Status
The current status of the project as of 31/05/2020;
Behaviour Trees can be made quite easily by creating a BehaviourTree object in a script that is placed on an A.I Agent. The trees can currently consist of Composite Nodes (Selector/Sequence) and Leaf Nodes, resulting in some relatively complex A.I behaviour.
Decorator Nodes are next up on the block and straight after that I'm excited to work on the Node Graph Editor.

I'm updating this read me now, but I believe I'll be implementing Decorator Nodes tomorrow and I'll simply just have to change all of this anyway. All well!
